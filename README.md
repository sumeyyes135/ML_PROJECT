SUPERVISED LEARNING METHOD IN MACHINE LEARNING USING HR ANALYTICS DATASET

In this study,it was aimed to create the analytical models that predict whether a
employee will leave the job or not.The dataset which was used in this project was
created for testing purposes and it is not organic.Because of this reason,there is no null values so only outlier analysis was implemented on this dataset.

In this method,Classfication method which is a subbranch of supervised
learning methods were used.Used algorithms are Logistic Regression,Decision
Tree(Gini),Decision Tree(Entropy) and Random Forest.For each model,the dataset
was divided into train and test sets , 75% and 25% ,respectively.

Those models,which were trained with the same training set using the corresponding functions in Jupyter Notebook with Python programming language,were tested with the same data set and the accuracy rates of them were compared.As a result of the comparison, with given data,it is observed that the model of the Logistic Regression has the highest accuracy rate of 88% .
